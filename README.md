## My Task

Is to build a web application from scratch, a portfolio page fulfilling acceptance criteria requirements as followed:

1. Previous work
2. Name, photo or avatar, links to sections about developer, 			developerâ€™s work, and how to contact developer.
3. Able to click one of the links in navigation
4. User Interface scrolls to corresponding section
5.  Click link about their work
6. WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
7. THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
8. WHEN I click on the images of the applications
9. THEN I am taken to that deployed application
10. WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
11. THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport.
